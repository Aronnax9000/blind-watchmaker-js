	<h2>Biomorph Engineering</h2>
    <p>
    Using Engineering Mode, you can manipulate the values of a biomorph's genes, 
    and see the result of the change in the body of the biomorph (its 'phenotype') in real time. 
    </p>
    <p>The row of values above the biomorph represent the biomorph's 'genes'.
    Some genes have purely numeric values. Other genes, such as Completeness and
    Spokes, have a limited range of possible non-numeric values.
    </p>
	<p>The biomorph shown by default is
		"BasicTree", the startup biomorph in the original 1986 version of
		Blind Watchmaker. You can choose one of the buttons below to generate either BasicTree,
		Chess, or Insect (the three hard-coded biomorph genotypes in Dawkins' original version).
		You can choose the "Saltation" button to
        generate a biomorph genotype at random. 
        </p>
	<p>
	You can manipulate the primary value of a gene by clicking on the left third or right
	third of the gene box. For numeric genes, the size of the change in value will be the
	value of the Mutation Size gene, the next-to-rightmost gene shown. 
	If Mutation Size is set to zero,
	you will notice no effect when you attempt to modify a numerical gene value. If that happens,
	increase Mutation Size to a non-zero value, and you will once again be able to manipulate
	the value of numeric genes.
	</p>
	<p>
	Some of the genes, namely, Gene 1 through Gene 9, and Segment Distance, also
	have 'gradient' genes. A gradient gene may take on one of three different values:
	Shrink (indicated by a dot at the lower left of the gene box), Swell (the dot moves to the
	top left), or Same (no dot at all). Gradient genes affect how the effect of the corresponding
	numerical gene value is increased, decreased, or kept the same as the biomorph is grown from
	the trunk to the leaves.
	</p>
	<p>
	You can manipulate gradient genes by clicking the
	upper, middle, or lower portion of the middle third (horizontally) of the gene box.
